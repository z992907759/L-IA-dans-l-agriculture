These processes boost microbial activity, improve soil structure, and enhance the nutrient profile, supporting healthy crop production.",Explain how green manures work as a soil fertility enhancer.,"Soil fertility • Regular additions of FYM and compost together with crop residues, such as green manures, cover crops, and grass/clover leys, will increase soil organic matter over time"
3443,"Cover crops play a critical role in preventing soil erosion by providing ground cover that protects the soil from wind and water erosion. Their roots stabilize the soil, and their biomass adds organic material upon decomposition, enhancing soil structure, moisture retention, and overall fertility.",Analyze the role of cover crops in preventing soil erosion and maintaining fertility.,"Soil fertility • Regular additions of FYM and compost together with crop residues, such as green manures, cover crops, and grass/clover leys, will increase soil organic matter over time"
3444,"Integrating farming systems such as crop rotation, use of cover crops, and the inclusion of organic inputs ensures diverse organic matter is added to the soil, which enhances nutrient cycling, improves soil structure, and maintains microbial diversity. This holistic approach fosters long-term soil health and agricultural sustainability.",Discuss the significance of integrating farming systems for long-term soil health.,"See sections 6, ‘Protecting soil fertility’ and 7, ‘Farming systems’."
3445,"Farmers can continuously improve soil organic matter by regularly adding farmyard manure (FYM), compost, and crop residues. Incorporating green manures, cover crops, and grass/clover leys is vital. These materials break down into organic matter, enriching the soil's fertility and structure consistently.",What strategies can farmers employ to continuously improve soil organic matter?,"Soil fertility • Regular additions of FYM and compost together with crop residues, such as green manures, cover crops, and grass/clover leys, will increase soil organic matter over time"
3446,"Farming systems significantly impact soil fertility management by incorporating practices like crop rotations, organic matter additions, and cover cropping. These methodologies ensure the balanced replenishment of essential nutrients, enhance soil structure, support microbial biodiversity, and prevent erosion, collectively improving the long-term productivity and sustainability of farming operations.",Evaluate the impact of farming systems on soil fertility management.,"See sections 6, ‘Protecting soil fertility’ and 7, ‘Farming systems’."
